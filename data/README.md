# Lepto-long-movements/data
Data files used in analyzing and plotting lesser long-nosed bat (_Leptonycteris yerbabuenae_) long-distance movements defined as greater than 178 km (i.e., more than two standard deviations above the mean foraging distance reported by a GPS tracking study at Pinacate Cave; Goldshtein et al. 2020). 

Due to data sensitivity concerns, roost locations have been withheld, but distances between roosts have been provided. Additionally, we have only provided PIT tag reader data for the tagged bats that have made long-distance movements given the size of our raw data files.
