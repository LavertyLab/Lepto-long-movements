# Lepto-long-movements/data
Data files used in analyzing and plotting lesser long-nosed bat (_Leptonycteris yerbabuenae_) long-distance movements defined as greater than 178 km (i.e., more than two standard deviations above the mean foraging distance reported by a GPS tracking study at Pinacate Cave; Goldshtein et al. 2020). 

## Tagging data
Tagging data (taggedLeptos.csv) includes information from bat captures and tagging. For each individual, the unique tag number in decimal, hexidecimal, and character format are included. We also include the site name, date of capture, species, age, sex, reproductive status of each individual on that date of capture, and contact information for the person responsible for those tagging events. Tag sites ending in "_h2o" indicate waterholes, while those ending in "_F" indicate foraging areas (either natural or hummingbird/oriole feeders).

## Reader data
Due to data sensitivity concerns, roost locations have been withheld, but distances between relevant roosts have been provided (roostdistance.csv). Additionally, given the size of our raw data files, we have only provided PIT tag reader data for the tagged bats that have made long-distance movements (PITtagreads.csv).
